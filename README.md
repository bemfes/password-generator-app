# About Project

This is a password generator with varying levels of complexity. You can generate passwords with various parameters, such as including lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. You can also set the password length. The generated password can then be copied using the button. The generated password will also display its strength.

The project was made using React, TypeScript, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Vite and FSD. [See the demo here](https://bemfes.github.io/password-generator-app/)
